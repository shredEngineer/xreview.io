**Decentralized Scientific Peer Review Platform**

xreview addresses the academic peer review crisis through composable trust networks. Researchers see only papers verified by scientists they personally trust, eliminating bottlenecks while maintaining quality standards.

## The Problem

Traditional peer review doesn't scale:
- Months of waiting for reviews
- Overworked, unpaid reviewers
- Gatekeeping by journal editors
- No transparency

## The Solution

**Composable Trust Networks**

Build a network of researchers whose judgment you trust. Papers are weighted by reviews from YOUR networkâ€”not generic "experts." This distributes authority while maintaining your quality standards.

### How It Works

1. Curate researchers you trust (1st degree connections)
2. See papers reviewed by your network
3. Trust scores weighted by network position and expertise
4. Transparent review process
