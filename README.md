**Decentralized Scientific Peer Review Platform**

xreview uses composable trust networks to solve the academic peer review crisis:

- You see only research verified by scientists you personally trust.
- This distributes authority while maintaining rigorous quality standards.

xreview operates as a decentralized platform with protocols that are transparent, auditable, and immutable.
Core review standards and algorithms are community-governed to ensure scientific rigor and prevent gaming of the system.

## The Problem

Traditional peer review doesn't scale:
- Months of waiting for reviews
- Overworked, unpaid reviewers
- Gatekeeping by journal editors
- No transparency

## The Solution

**Composable Trust Networks** distribute authority while maintaining your quality standards:

- Build a network of researchers whose judgment you trust.
- Papers are weighted by reviews from YOUR network â€” not generic "experts."
